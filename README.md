## Abstract
Being modulated by a carrier wave of appropriate frequency, digital signals are transmitted in
communication channels, bandpass in nature. Consequently, a receiver has to be wisely designed to
distinguish the transmitted bits in the presence of noise with the least probability of error. The report first
shows a sample pipeline visualization of a 100-bit random generated signal with a low SNR through the
simulation. Then, it shows the same pipeline for a suitable SNR value for the same 100-bit. Finally, it gives
analytical discussion for different signals scenarios of different number of transmitted bits in the MATLAB
simulation of optimum receiver for detecting BPSK and BFSK signals.
